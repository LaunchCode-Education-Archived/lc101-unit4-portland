This six week unit is split into three tracks:

* A **Job Track** where you will learn and practice job hunting skills
* A **Group Project** track where you will work on a team to apply your existing skills (and learn a few more) by creating a small web app 
* A **Technical Track** where you will learn intermediate topics: Algorithms, Data Structures, Intro to JavaScript in the browser

##Not as flipped as we'd like
In contrast to units 1, 2, and 3, this unit is being developed on the fly and assembled "just in time". While we'll make every effort to have prep materials ready for you to work on before class, that won't be possible in many cases.

##One big assignment

Instead of several assignments, We have just one: your group project. Instead of doing assigned homework, you will spend your non-class time will be working in teams on your projects and doing self-directed study on topics relevant to your projects.

##Location
The class location varies from session to session. Currently all classes are schedule for classrooms in the Smith Memorial Student Union (SMSU) on the PSU campus. Check the [classes](../classes/README.md) page and monitor the Slack #general channel for the most up to date location information.
