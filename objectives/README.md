* Complete your first project iteration

Technical

* Create JavaScript for web browser environments
* Create basic JavaScript methods and objects
* Setting up github repositories for collaborative teamwork
* Using github issues for project tracking of feature development.
* Special topics in front-end development (driven from group project requirements)


### Week 3

Job Readiness

* Understand and practice effective Technical interview techniques

Group Project

* Review effective code collaboration techniques with git branching and merging
* Plan second iteration (prototype development)
* Start first working prototype

Technical
* Use step-by-step process for class and method definition - the Rigorous Method Creation Process (RMCP)

* Use the RMCP to develop unit tests

### Week 4

Job Readiness

* Understand and practice soft skills in interviews

Group Project

* Conduct iteration retrospectives

Technical

* Describe and implement binary and linear search
* Explain the difference between different measures of efficiency: constant, linear, logarithmic, polynomial, exponential
* Use big-O notation to describe the efficiency of an algorithm as an upper bound

### Week 5

Job Readiness

* Understand and practice business ettiquette

Group Project

* Apply agile project management to trim backlog and finish on schedule - what's important to the customer? What's a minimum viable product?
* Plan third and final iteration (prototype refinement and first customer ship)

Technical

* Describe the concept of a recursive algorithm/function
* Implement basic recursive algorithms

### Week 6

Job Readiness

* Practice, practice, practice interview technique

Group Project

* Finish third iteration
* Conduct iteration retrospective
* Finish project

Technical

* Describe and visualize arrays as contiguous storage structures of fixed size
* Describe drawbacks to using arrays (problems with over/under allocation)
* Describe and visualize linked lists as non-contiguous data structures of flexible size
* Define random and sequential access, along with positives and negatives of each; state which type of access arrays and linked lists allow
* Identify which previously-encountered data structures are either arrays (Java arrays) or linked lists (Python lists, Java ArrayLists)
* Describe efficiency of basic operations for arrays and linked lists in big-O form (read, insert, remove)
* Special topics in full-stack development (driven from group project requirements)
